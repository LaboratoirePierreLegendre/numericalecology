These files are compressed with zip 2.01, and shouldbe transferred as binaries. If you do not have the unzip 5.0 decompression utility, you may download it from:ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/VMS/Pascal sources are bilingual. Simply select the .com files in the language ofyour choice.Notes=====o   The current programmer of "R" version 4 is totally clueless in how this    VAX version works. For VAX-specific questions, please ask Pierre Legendre    (legendre@ere.umontreal.ca).    o   The documentation is available in Macintosh Self-reading, MacWrite II     (see in the parent directory) and compressed PostScript (.ps.zip) formats. --Philippe Casgrain, casgrain@magellan.umontreal.caAugust 26th, 2002
