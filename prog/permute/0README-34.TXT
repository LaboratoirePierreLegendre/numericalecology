The program was originally introduced in:Legendre, P., Lapointe, F.-J., & Casgrain, P. (1994). Modeling brain evolutionfrom behavior: a permutational regression approach. Evolution, 48, 1487-1499.The new version is quite different from the previous one, and I have spent lots of hours on it. If you would like to take a look, please do soat the following addresses:<http://alize.ere.umontreal.ca/~casgrain/en/labo/permute/><ftp://biol10.biol.umontreal.ca/public_ftp/labo/permute/>This version has been extensively tested in-house, and is much more robust/easyto use than the previous one. It is native on Macs and PowerMacs. And of courseit's still free! Please try a few analyses using your data and report the bugs(if any) back to me.Best wishes,Philippe Casgraincasgrain@magellan.umontreal.ca
