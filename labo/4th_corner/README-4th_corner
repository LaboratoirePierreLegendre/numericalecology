Le Quatrieme Coin/The 4th-CornerPierre LegendreMay 1996Departement de sciences biologiquesUniversite de MontrealThe 4th-corner method, which was presented at the NT-95 meeting, offers away of analyzing relationships between the supplementary variablesassociated with the rows and columns of a binary (presence-absence) datatable (Legendre et al. , in press). The problem which motivated thedevelopment of the method is the following: How does one relate thebiological and behavioral characteristics of animals (matrix B) to habitatcharacteristics of the locations at which they are found (matrix C), giventhe distribution of animals across sampling sites (matrix A)? Statisticalparameters in matrix D are estimated by the following matrix operation: D =C A' B. They are tested for significance using a permutation procedure.Random permutations of matrix A can be obtained under four differentpermutational models.Documents available for distribution include:   * Tiahura transect fish data set     Text files of the data used in the journal article below        o For Macintosh computers (self-extracting binhexed archive)        o For DOS/Windows computers (shorter names, different line endings,          zip archive)   * Macintosh version     Self-extracting binhexed archive        o Program FORTRAN source code        o Compiled versions of the program for Macintosh computers using          680x0, 680x0 + FPU, or PowerPC processor        o Program documentation, in Word 5 (Macintosh)        o A folder containing three ASCII files, called A1, B1 and C1,          corresponding to Example 1 of the documentation   * DOS/Text-only version     Compressed using the zip format        o Program FORTRAN source code.        o 16- and 32-bit compiled versions of the program for DOS computers        o Program documentation, in Word for Windows 2        o A folder containing three ASCII files, called A1, B1 and C1,          corresponding to Example 1 of the documentationThe program documentation files have been designed to be printed in eitherUS Letter or A4 formats.Reference:Legendre, P., R.
