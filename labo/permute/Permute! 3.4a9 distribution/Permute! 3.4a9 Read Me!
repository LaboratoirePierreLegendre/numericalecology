An HTML version with pictures can be found on the Web:<http://www.fas.umontreal.ca/BIOL/Casgrain/en/labo/permute/>Hardware and software requirementsAny Macintosh/MacOS compatible computer capable of running System 7.0 and up should be able to run Permute! 3.4, which has been tested extensively on many machines. Power Macintoshes should have at least System 7.5.3, which is available free of charge on ftp.apple.com.It is desirable, but not necessary. that you have a low-level debugger such as MacsBug installed to help when reporting crashes. There are instructions in the documentation relating to that.Important known problemsThis is alpha software. Obvious bugs have been squashed, but others are sure to remain.
