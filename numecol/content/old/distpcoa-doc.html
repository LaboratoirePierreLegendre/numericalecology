This procedure is used as part of the distance-based redundancy analysis method (db-RDA) proposed by Legendre & Anderson (1998a). It may also be used in any other case where one wishes to obtain a full Euclidean representation of a distance matrix. If negative eigenvalues are produced, the correction methods available in this program allow one to obtain a full Euclidean representation in all cases.The program can either read in a pre-computed distance matrix, or calculate a distance matrix from a raw data table. Five distance functions are available within the program: Bray-Curtis, square root of Bray-Curtis, chi-square, Hellinger, and Euclidean. Descriptions of these distances can be found in Legendre & Legendre (1998), among other texts.The program uses a Householder procedure for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square distance matrix. The subroutines (TRED2, TQLI) are from Chapter 11 of Numerical Recipes (Press <i>et al.</i>, 1986).Negative eigenvalues may be generated during the principal coordinate analysis of semimetric or nonmetric distance measures. For descriptions and comparisons of properties of various distance measures, see Gower & Legendre (1986) and Legendre & Legendre (1998). For example, the Bray-Curtis distance, which is widely used in ecology with species abundance data and is offered by the program, is a semimetric. Negative eigenvalues may also be produced during the analysis of some metric distances which do not guarantee a full Euclidean representation, as shown by Gower & Legendre (1986); see also Legendre & Legendre (1998, Table 7.2). The problem of negative eigenvalues is that the corresponding ordination axes are imaginary, their lengths being the square roots of their eigenvalues. Corrections for negative eigenvalues may be obtained using two methods:<ol><li> Lingoes method: d&#8217;(i,j)<sup>2</sup> = d(i,j)<sup>2</sup> + 2c<sub>1</sub>   where c<sub>1</sub> is the absolute value of the largest negative eigenvalue of the first PCoA run. Note that d(i,i) = 0.<li> Cailliez method: d&#8217;(i,j) = d(i,j) + c<sub>2</sub>   where c<sub>2</sub> is the largest eigenvalue of a special non-symmetric matrix. Note that d(i,i) = 0. The eigenvalues of the special matrix are found using a QR algorithm for real Hessenberg matrices. The subroutines (BALANC, ELMHES, and HQR) are from Chapter 11 of Numerical Recipes (Press <i>et al.</i>, 1986).</ol>Metric measures, such as square-root-transformed Bray-Curtis, chi-square, Hellinger or Euclidean distances, will give all positive eigenvalues in the PCoA analysis, so no correction  is needed.Methods 1 and 2 are described in Gower & Legendre (1986, theorem 7), in Legendre & Anderson (1998a), and in Legendre & Legendre (1998). The fact that square-root-transformed Bray-Curtis distances give all positive eigenvalues in PCoA is substantiated in Legendre & Anderson (1998a). For use with db-RDA, Legendre and Anderson (1998a) have shown that correction method 1 does not affect the test of the analysis-of-variance statistic by permutation. Thus they recommend the use of correction method 1 in that context.<b>Input files</b>The input data file is an ASCII text file. <ol><li> It may contain a raw data file, where objects (i.e. sites, replicates, etc.) are rows and variables (i.e. species or other descriptors) are columns. There is no identifier of any sort at the beginning of the file. Neither columns nor rows should have any labels whatsoever. The program asks the user how many objects and variables there are before reading the file.<li> It may contain a square distance or similarity matrix computed using some other program; the diagonal is included in the matrix. There is no identifier of any sort at the beginning of the file or at the beginning of the rows. The only values in the file must be distances. The program asks the user how many objects there are in the distance matrix before reading the file.</ol><b>Options of the program</b>The following choices are offered by the program:<ol><li> Input data file: a square distance or similarity matrix, or a raw  data file.<li> A variety of preliminary data transformations are available for the analysis of raw data files, if desired: square root (i.e. <i>y&#8217;</i> = <i>y</i><sup>1/2</sup>), double square root (i.e. <i>y&#8217;</i> = <i>y</i><sup>1/4</sup>), as well as four logarithmic transformations: <i>y</i>&#8217; = ln(<i>y</i>), <i>y</i>&#8217; = ln(<i>y</i> + 1), <i>y</i>&#8217; = log<sub>10</sub>(<i>y</i>), and <i>y</i>&#8217; = log<sub>10</sub>(<i>y</i> + 1).<li> For raw input data files, users may choose to compute one of the following distances: <ul><li> Bray-Curtis distance<li> sqrt(Bray-Curtis distance)<li> Chi-square distance<li> Hellinger distance <li> Euclidean distance</ul><li> Correction for negative eigenvalues:<ul><li> Method 1 (Lingoes)<li> Method 2 (Cailliez)<li> No correction</ul></ol>If a metric distance measure has been chosen, then no correction is necessary and this option will be obtained by the program regardless of the choice made here. Choosing &#8220;No correction&#8221; will only change the analysis explicitly if there are negative eigenvalues produced (for example, with Bray-Curtis distances).  In that case, the eigenvectors corresponding to the negative eigenvalues will be ignored and only the coordinates corresponding to the positive eigenvalues will be output.<b>Output files</b>The run dialogue as well as the uncorrected and corrected eigenvalues are given in the dialogue window. The eigenvectors are given in a separate output file called P<small>COORD.TXT</small>. If a correction for negative eigenvalues has been done, the coordinates in the output file are those of the corrected eigenvalues. The rows of this file correspond to the objects and the columns are the coordinates (i.e. variables) in the new system of axes. This file can be used directly as input to other programs of data analysis. For users of the db-RDA procedure, in particular, this file may become the &#8220;Species&#8221; matrix of a redundancy analysis using the C<small>ANOCO</small> program.<b>Disclaimer</b>This program is provided without any explicit or implicit warranty of correct functioning. It has been developed as part of a university-based research program. If, however, you should encounter problems with this program, the authors will be happy to help solve them. Researchers may use this program for scientific purposes, but the source code remains the property of Pierre Legendre and Marti J. Anderson. Publications should give proper credit to the method by referring to the Legendre & Anderson (1998a) paper.
