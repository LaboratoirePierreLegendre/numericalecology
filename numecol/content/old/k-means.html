<H2>K-Means least-squares partitioning method</H2><h3>Updated July 27th, 2001</h3><small><A HREF="http://numericalecology.com/">Pierre Legendre</A><BR>July 2001<BR>D&eacute;partement de Sciences Biologiques<BR>Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al<BR></small>K-means is a least-squares partitioning method allowing users to divide a collection of objects into K groups. The theory is presented in all textbooks of numerical classification methods, including section 8.8 of <a href="#ref">Legendre and Legendre (1998)</a>. The program implements a simple alternating least-squaresalgorithm, the same one as used in the SAS FASTCLUS procedure. The algorithm iterates between two simple steps:<ul><li>Compute cluster centroids and use them as new cluster seeds.<li>Assign each object to the nearest seed.</ul>Among the 20 or so algorithms that have been described for K-means partitioning, this one is known to be the fastest; it also has good convergence properties. In the course of the iterations, the program tries to minimise the sum, over all groups, of the squared within-group residuals, which are the distances of the objects to the respective group centroids. Convergence is reached when the objective function (i.e., the residual sum-of-squares) cannot be loweredany more. The groups obtained are such that they are geometrically as compact as possible around their respective centroids.Since K-means partitioning is one of the so-called &#8220;NP-hard problems&#8221;, no algorithm can guarantee that the absolute minimum of the objective function has been reached; any given run of K-means partitioning may end up in what is called a &#8220;local minimum&#8221; of the objective function. A strategy, described in the User's guide, helps users find a value of the objective function which is likely to represent the overall minimum.New in July 2001 is the ability to specify an initial list of centroids to start the K-Means partition with.<h3>Program availability</h3><UL>	<LI><b><a href="../download.html#KMeans">Macintosh version</a> </b>	<UL>		<LI>Compiled versions of the program for any Macintosh computer (fat binary)		<LI>Program documentation, in Adobe <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep2.html">Acrobat</a> format	</UL>	<LI><b><a href="../download.html#KMeans">32-bit DOS version</a> </b>(The executable file is a Win32 "console" executable, not a DOS executable.
