The problem which motivated the development of the method is thefollowing: How does one relate the biological and behavioral characteristics ofanimals (matrix <B>B</B>) to habitat characteristics of the locations at which they arefound (matrix <B>C</B>), given the distribution of animals across sampling sites(matrix <B>A</B>)? Statistical parameters in matrix <B>D</B> are estimated by the followingmatrix operation: <B>D</B> = <B>C</B> <B>A</B>' <B>B</B>. They are tested for significance using a permutation procedure. Random permutations of matrix <B>A</B> can be obtained under four different permutational models.Documents available for distribution include: <UL>	<LI><b><a href="../download.html#The4thCorner">Macintosh version</a> </b>	<UL>		<LI><a href="fortran.html">Fortran</a> source code		<LI>Compiled versions of the program for Macintosh computers using 680x0, 680x0 + FPU, or PowerPC processor		<LI>Program documentation, in Word 5 (Macintosh)		<LI>A folder containing three ASCII files, called A1, B1 and C1, corresponding to Example 1 of the documentation	</UL>	<P>	For the researcher with a huge dataset, we have <a href="../download.html#The4thCorner">compiled a version</a>  (PowerMacintosh only) that can accomodate 550 species, 800 stations and 50 behavioral / habitat characteristics. The usual program limits are 300, 30 and 30 respectively. This bigger version requires about 15 megabytes of RAM to function, it will not work in less. So if you have a smaller problem, please use the regular version above. 	<LI><b><a href="../download.html#The4thCorner">DOS/Text-only version</a> </b>	<UL>		<LI><a href="fortran.html">Fortran</a> source code.		<LI>16- and 32-bit compiled versions of the program for DOS computers		<LI>Program documentation, in Word for Windows 2 		<LI>A folder containing three ASCII files, called A1, B1 and C1, corresponding to Example 1 of the documentation	</UL>	<LI><b><a name="data"></a><a href="../download.html#The4thCorner">Download the Tiahura transect fish data set</a> </b> 	Text files of the data used in the journal article below	</UL>The program documentation files have been designed to be printed in either US Letter or A4 formats.<a name="ref">Reference:</a><BR><blockquote>Legendre, P., R.
