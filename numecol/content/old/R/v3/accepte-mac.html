Please consult the <a href="nouveau.html">news page</a> for information about updated modules. Version 3.02 is a re-compilation with some bug fixes of version 3.01, and runs under OS 8.1. It has not been tested extensively; use at your own risk. If you find what you think is a bug (or a crash, a cosmetic problem...), please <a href="../../../../en/commentaires.html">report it to us immediately</a> . We will try to fix it or suggest a work-around as quickly as possible. <A HREF="../v4/">Version 4.0</A>, with numerous bugfixes, speed improvements and a complete interface overhaul will be availablesoon. For this reason, we suggest that you <A HREF="../v4/joindre-liste.html">join the R Package 4.0 User List</A>. You will receive notices (<EM>not</EM>the executables!) of the new version as soon as it comes out. It will be available via anonymous ftp. The current estimate for release of the betaversion is around late 1998.The program exists in English and French versions, which are functionallyidentical. Simply download whichever version suits you most.<H3>Note</H3>Documentation is available in Macintosh self-reading (with full search capabilities!) MacWrite II and PostScript (ps) formats. The Macintosh files arecompressed and binhexed while the .ps files are Unix tarred-, compressed and uuencoded (.tar.Z.uu). Whew!<BR>Note that the .ps files have Unix-style (line-feed) line endings, as opposed toMac-style (carriage-return) or DOS-style (carriage-return+line-feed).<BR><EM>European users:</EM> the documentation is setup as US letter. Unfortunately,an A4 version is not available.<UL>	<LI>	Download the English version of the programs		<UL>			<LI>	<a href="../../../download.html#TheRPackageVersion3forMacintoshcomputers">Download the new English version 3.02</a> 			<LI>	<a href="../../../download.html#TheRPackageVersion3forMacintoshcomputers">Download the older English version 3.01</a> 		</UL>	<LI>	<a href="../../../download.html#TheRPackageVersion3forMacintoshcomputers">Download the "Piste" program for path analysis</a> 	<LI>	Download the English version of the documentation		<UL>			<LI>	<a href="../../../download.html#TheRPackageVersion3forMacintoshcomputers">Macintosh self-reading format (recommended)</a> 			<LI>	<a href="../../../download.html#TheRPackageVersion3forMacintoshcomputers">MacWrite II format</a> 			<LI>	<a href="../../../download.html#TheRPackageVersion3forMacintoshcomputers">PostScript format</a> 		</UL></UL>			<p>			<hr>			<h6 align=center>				Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A> <br>				Created on  Saturday, April 05, 1997				</h6>			<!--<h6 align="center"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://www.jsp.umontreal.ca/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=http://twitter.com/philippeclabo/R/v3/accepte-mac.html"> accesses since February 22nd, 2000</h6>-->		</TD>	</TR></TABLE>
