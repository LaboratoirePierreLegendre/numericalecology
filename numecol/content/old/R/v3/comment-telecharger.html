That particular port has never left the development stage, has been in limited release in 1993 and will never be released again. <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A> is now working full-time on the Macintosh version, and he will begin work on a 32-bit Windows version as soon as the Macintosh version is released. Our priorities are to the Macintosh version, but it is being written in such a way that core code can be re-used without modification (in a .DLL for instance) in a future Windows version. There is hope yet, but it will take a while (over a year from now).</blockquote>			<p>			<hr>			<h6 align=center>				Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A> <br>				Created on  Saturday, April 05, 1997				</h6>			<!--<h6 align="center"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://www.jsp.umontreal.ca/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=http://twitter.com/philippeclabo/R/v3/comment-telecharger.html"> accesses since February 22nd, 2000</h6>-->		</TD>	</TR></TABLE>
