---title: R: Periodograph---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does PERIODOGRAPH do ?</STRONG>	Program PERIODOGRAPH computes and plots a contingency periodogram<A HREF="../references.html#21">(Legendre <EM>et al.</EM>, 1981)</A> for a univariate space or time series.The data may be qualitative (nominal), semi-quantitative (ordinal), orquantitative. Quantitative and semi-quantitative data must first bedivided into classes before computing this periodogram; the programtakes care of this division, following an optimality criterion. In theperiodogram itself, the contingency statistic is computed for allperiods in the observation window, that is, periods <EM>T</EM> = 2 to<EM>T</EM> = <EM>n</EM>/2 where <EM>n</EM> is the length of the dataseries; in the Macintosh version, the user may choose a narrowercomputation window. Legendre &amp; Legendre (in <A HREF="../references.html#22">1984a, vol. 2</A>, and morebriefly in their <A HREF="../references.html#13">1983 book</A>), as well as the above-mentioned paper,provide more details on the method. Besides its capacity to analyzesemi-quantitative or qualitative data series, the method also allows toanalyze short series, which is not the case with the Schusterperiodogram or spectral analysis, for example. The method also allowsto analyze multivariate time series, by first computing a multivariatepartitioning of the data series (through clustering), followed byperiodogram analysis of the resulting data partition, as proposed inthe <A HREF="../references.html#21">1981 paper</A>; however, one should prefer to compute a Mantelcorrelogram (see program <A HREF="mantel.html">MANTEL</A>) instead of a contingency periodogramin this case. Another advantage of the Mantel correlogram method isthat it is not restricted to data with a constant sampling interval.	Dividing a quantitative or semi-quantitative variable into classesis accomplished by a procedure which optimizes the following twocriteria, in such a way as to take tied values (<EM>ex aequo</EM>) ofthe data series into account:<OL><LI>For a given number of classes, one minimizes the sum ofwithin-class sums of squares; this part of the computations is doneeither on the raw data, or on ranks.<LI>The program selects the number of classes that maximizes theamount of entropy per class.</OL><BR>A stepwise algorithm, transcribed into procedure APPROX of the program,is described in the <A HREF="../references.html#21">Legendre <EM>et al.</EM> (1981: 969-973)</A> paper.That procedure first looks for the two-class partition which minimizesthe first criterion; then, <EM>keeping the first division fixed</EM>,one looks for a second cutting point which would create three classesminimizing again the minimum variance criterion; and so on until thesecond criterion is maximized. A second algorithm has recently beencreated by A. Vaudor. This method, translated into procedure EXACT ofthe program, finds at each step the optimal partition of theobservations into <EM>k</EM> classes, <EM>independently of the classlimits found during the previous step</EM>; the partition thatmaximizes the amount of information per class is retained. The programuses procedure EXACT whenever possible. One should notice that withthis algorithm, the second criterion is often optimized for threeclasses. The user can always impose another number of classes if she sowishes.<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
