---title: R: K-Means---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does K-MEANS do ?</STRONG>	Program K-MEANS computes a non-hierarchical clustering byminimization of the within-group variance, following several variantsof the method originally proposed by <A HREF="../references.html#7">MacQueen (1967)</A>, to which he gavethe name <EM>k-means</EM>. This is a <EM>partitioning</EM> method for agroup of objects, and not a method of hierarchical classification. Theuser decides how many groups, <EM>k</EM>, she wants to obtain from theprogram. The <EM>k</EM>-means algorithm followed here is the onedescribed on page 163 of <A HREF="../references.html#8">Anderberg (1973)</A>. The present program computesthe clustering with or without contiguity constraint (spatial ortemporal), following the user's request. It complements thehierarchical clustering programs of the R package, whichimplement various algorithms of clustering without constraint (<A HREF="cluster.html">CLUSTER</A> in the Macintosh version) or with contiguity constraint (<A HREF="biogeo.html">BIOGEO</A> and<A HREF="chrono.html">CHRONO</A>).<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
