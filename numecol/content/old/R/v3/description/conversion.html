---title: R: Convert---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does CONVERT do ?</STRONG>	CONVERT is a utility program to conversion a <A HREF="simil.html">SIMIL</A>-type similarity (S)matrix into a distance (D) matrix, or vice versa. 	This program has been written because most of the programs in Rrequire that the <A HREF="simil.html">SIMIL</A>-type file provided as input be of the<EM>similarity</EM> type. So, distance files must be converted in manyinstances; when distances are larger than 1, the first type oftransformation produces negative "similarities"; notice thatdespite of that, the programs that use these similarity files have beenbuilt to handle the values correctly. The last forms of transformationguarantees that all the similarities obtained after transformation arein the [0, 1] interval.<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
