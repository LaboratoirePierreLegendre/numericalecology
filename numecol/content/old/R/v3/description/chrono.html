---title: R: Chrono---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does CHRONO do ?</STRONG>	The chronological clustering proposed by <A HREF="../references.html#4">Legendre, Dallot&amp; Legendre (1985)</A> is computed by program CHRONO. This clusteringmethod, which had first been described for multivariate time series,can also be used to segment spatial series <A HREF="../references.html#5">(Galzin &amp; Legendre,1987)</A>. The non-hierarchical method uses a hierarchicalproportional-link linkage algorithm whose connectedness level(<EM>Co</EM>) is determined by the user as an answer to a question ofthe program; it is the test of significance, described in the nextparagraph, that makes the method non-hierarchical. The constraint ofspatial or temporal contiguity imposed to the clustering results meansthat only objects or object groups that are <EM>adjacent</EM> along theseries may eventually groupements. Notice that it is unlikely that changingthe connectedness would produce a major change in the clusteringresults, as can be seen in the examples of the <A HREF="../references.html#4">Legendre, Dallot &amp;Legendre (1985)</A> paper.	At each step of the agglomeration, a permutation test is performedto decide whether a fusion should be made between the two groups whosefusion is proposed by the agglomerative algorithm. The null hypothesisof that test is explicitly described in the output of versions CMS andVMS:<BLOCKQUOTE>     H is the probability that the null hypothesis is true. The     null hypothesis says that the two groups being tested  are     an artifact and should be fused in a single group.  Fusion     occurs if H is larger than the probability level ALPHA set     by the user (above).</BLOCKQUOTE>Answering a question of the program, the user must determine the<EM>alpha</EM> rejection level of the null hypothesis (often chosenvalues are 0.01, 0.05 or 0.10; one may choose to use a higher level inorder to identify singletons -- see below, as well as the example). Onemust realize, though, that this is not a genuine test of statisticalhypothesis, since the data used during the test are the same as thosefrom which the hypothesis of division into groups has been generated.Numerical simulations described in the main reference have shown,however, that for random data sets, the probability for this test ofproducing a significant result is equal to the preselected<EM>alpha</EM> value.	The program allows to identify <EM>singletons</EM>, which areaberrant samples found along the data series. Because of the constraintof contiguity imposed on the algorithm, the presence of a singleton mayprevent the formation of a group that should have included objects fromboth sides of the aberrant sample. At least three reasons may producesuch aberrant samples: (1) random events, such as modified strata insediment cores, or else movements of water masses during repeatedsamplings at the same station in aquatic environment; (2) impropersampling or inadequate preservation of the samples before they areanalyzed; (3) extreme stochastic variations, which lead to rejectingthe null hypothesis while no break has occurred in the succession (typeII error).	If the user requests to identify the singletons, the clustering willbe interrupted, and started again from the beginning after removing thesingleton (see example); the only exceptions to this rule are thesingletons located at the beginning or the end of the data series,since no group is interrupted by their presence. It is unlikely thatsingletons will be identified if the <EM>alpha</EM> level is low (lessthan 10%), because it then becomes difficult, when testing a singleobject against p, to obtain a value which is smaller than that in thefirst column of Table 1. Final rule: if an object has a similarity ofzero with all its immediate neighbors, the agglomerative algorithm doesnot go down to level <EM>S</EM> = 0 to force such an object to pertainto a group; these unclustered objects are represented by dashes (-) inthe final solution, or by a white square in the Macintosh output graph.It is recommended to check the data for any object coming out with thatsymbol; if its presence in the series seems to have interrupted agroup, this object may either be removed from the analysis if it isconsidered aberrant or exceptional (which may have given it a nullsimilarity with its neighbors).<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
