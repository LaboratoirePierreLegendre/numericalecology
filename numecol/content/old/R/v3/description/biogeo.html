Since the clustering is computed from a similarity matrix, whichis of multivariate origin in most instances, then this method may beconsidered as a form of multivariate mapping.	This agglomerative clustering uses a proportional-link linkagealgorithm; another program of this package, <A HREF="kmeans.html">K-MEANS</A>, allows to computea non-hierarchical space-constrained clustering. The connectedness ofthe clustering algorithm is determined by the user, between 0 (forsingle linkage) and 1 (for complete linkage). <A HREF="../references.html#3">Legendre (1987)</A>has shown that the results of constrained clustering are fairly stable through awide range of values of connectedness.	In the Macintosh version, the program is limited to a maximum of 150simultaneous groups at any one clustering level. Problems larger than1000 localities have been analyzed using this program; it may becomenecessary in such cases to request more core memory than attributed tousers by default.<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
