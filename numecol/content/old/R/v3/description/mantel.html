---title: R: Mantel---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does MANTEL do ?</STRONG>	Program MANTEL computes <A HREF="../references.html#14">Mantel's (1967)</A> <EM>Z</EM> statistic betweentwo similarity or distance matrices, as well as the derived formsdescribed below: partial Mantel tests, Mantel correlogram. Thesignificance of Mantel's statistic may be evaluated either bypermutations, or through the normal approximation described by Mantel(who called that statistic<EM> t</EM>; its distribution isasymptotically normal). Since the probability obtained from the normalapproximation rapidly converges towards the permutational probability,it becomes useless to use the permutational test when it would be morecostly in computer time, that is, with problems containing manyobjects. <A HREF="../references.html#1">Legendre &amp; Fortin (1989)</A> present a brief account of theMantel permutational test. 	Notice that the value of the <EM>Z</EM> statistic computed by thisprogram is half that of <A HREF="../references.html#14">Mantel (1967)</A>, because the computations aredone on half-matrices of similarities or distances; Mantel's <EM>t</EM>statistic, however, as well as Hubert's standardization of <EM>Z</EM>,are computed as if the matrices were square. The standardized Mantelstatistic (<EM>r</EM>) is not affected by computations onhalf-matrices.	Besides its applications in spatial analysis, the Mantel test isuseful in a number of other statistical situations. <A HREF="../references.html#15">Hubert <EM>etal.</EM> (1982)</A>, as well as <A HREF="../references.html#16">McCune &amp; Allen (1985)</A>, <A HREF="../references.html#17">Burgman (1987)</A>,<A HREF="../references.html#18">Hudon &amp; Lamarche (1989)</A> and <A HREF="../references.html#1">Legendre &amp; Fortin (1989)</A>, have usedit to test the goodness-of-fit of models to data. <A HREF="../references.html#19">Legendre &amp;Troussellier (1988)</A> as well as <A HREF="../references.html#1">Legendre &amp; Fortin (1989)</A> have usedthe Smouse-Long-Sokal partial Mantel tests in a causal modelingframework. <A HREF="../references.html#20">Sokal <EM>et al.</EM> (1987)</A> have proposed to limit thepermutations during the Mantel test in such a way as to evaluate whichone among two rival alternative hypotheses (H1) fits the data better;an example is provided in the section on limited permutations (Optionsof the program, section 8 of the documentation).<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
