---title: R: PCoord---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does PCOORD do ?</STRONG>	Program PCOORD produces a reduced-space ordination following themethod of principal coordinates analysis <A HREF="../references.html#12">(Gower, 1966)</A>. Like principalcomponents analysis, this is a <EM>metric multidimensional scaling</EM>method. The computations, however, are made on a <EM>similarity</EM> or<EM>distance</EM> matrix instead of a raw data table; this is also thecase with the methods of <EM>nonmetric multidimensionalscaling.</EM>	Each distance <EM>d</EM> is first transformed into a new distance<EM>d' </EM>=<EM> </EM>-<EM>d^</EM><I>2</I>/2 before centering thematrix using the formula<EM>alpha = d' - d'bar</EM><EM>i</EM><EM> - d'bar</EM><EM>j</EM><EM> +d'bar</EM>where <EM>d'bar</EM><EM>i</EM><EM> </EM>and<EM>d'bar</EM><EM>j</EM><EM> </EM>are respectively the mean of row<EM>i</EM> and of column <EM>j</EM> in distance matrix <EM>d'</EM>,while <EM>d'bar</EM> is the mean of all the values in the matrix. Thenew coordinates of the objects in reduced space are the eigenvectors ofthat centered matrix, after normalization to the square root of theireigenvalues.	There are in principle no limits to the size of the matrices that canbe analyzed by the Macintosh version; the program occupies all theavailable RAM space in the computer, so that the size of the matricesthat can be analyzed is, in practice, a function not only of the sizeof the memory available in the machine, but also of the simultaneoususe of MultiFinder, of a RAM cache, or of other programs. <h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
