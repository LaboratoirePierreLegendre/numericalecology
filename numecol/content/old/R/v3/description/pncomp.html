---title: R: PnComp---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does PNCOMP do ?</STRONG>	Program PNCOMP produces a reduced-space ordination using themethod of principal component analysis (PCA) described in all textbooksof multivariate statistics. That very general method of analysisincludes several variants; the main ones are briefly discussed in Table3 of the documentation.	We have written only a Macintosh version of this program, since manyother packages offer this type of analysis on mainframes. Thecomputations are made from a raw data table, which may contain missingvalues. The program produces graphs as well as a file of results, ifthe user request them. For the time being, the program can handle nomore than 55 variables<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
