---title: R: VerNorm---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does VERNORM do ?</STRONG>	VERNORM is a multiple-purpose program designed to beused at the beginning of the analysis of a data table. It has beencreated to answer general needs concerning input data files. Its namemeans VERify and NORMalize; it can transpose a matrix, reformat thedata, add or remove object identifiers (although, on microcomputers,that function is more easily carried out by spreadsheet programs), drawhistograms, divide variables into classes, standardize data, ortransform them in various ways. VERNORM can handle missing values.Eliminating rows or columns from a data file can be done by spreadsheetprograms, or through the editors of various types available onmicrocomputers; statistical analysis programs can be used to transformthe data in ways not available in VERNORM.<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
