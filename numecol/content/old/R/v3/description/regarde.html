---title: R: Look---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does LOOK do ?</STRONG>	Program LOOK allows to regarde at the binary files written by <A HREF="simil.html">SIMIL</A> or<A HREF="importexport.html">IMPORT-EXPORT</A> (Macintosh version); these matrices cannot be readdirectly because they are written in binary and not in ASCII. Since theuser is often interested only to regarde at the block of generalinformation at the beginning of the file (title, date, function, numberof objects, number of descriptors), a first window, in the Macintoshversion, presents only that information. After that, the user isinvited to request that the binary file be copied into an ASCII file,if he so desires. In the output file, after the block of information ofthe file, only the upper triangle of the resemblance matrix is printed,together with the object names identifying the rows and columns.<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
