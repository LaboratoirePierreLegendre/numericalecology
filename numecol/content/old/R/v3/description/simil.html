---title: R: Simil---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does SIMIL do ?</STRONG>	SIMIL computes resemblance measures, either for binary(presence-absence) data, or for quantitative variables. The programallows the user to compute any of the measures described in Chapter 6of the <A HREF="../references.html#13">Legendre &amp; Legendre (1983)</A> textbook, except for the partialcorrelation coefficients. In the documentation, Table 4 lists theavailable coefficients, while Tables 5 to 7 summarize the criteria thatmay guide the user when choosing a coefficient. Four types of files,whose role is explained in detail in the documentation, may be used inconjunction with this program; the dashed arrows identify files thatare only used in connection with some of the coefficients.<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
