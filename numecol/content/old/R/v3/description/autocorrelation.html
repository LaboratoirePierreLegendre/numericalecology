---title: R: Autocorrelation---<img src="../../../../../images/r3-icon-t.gif" height="32" width="32" align="middle" alt="[R 3.0 icon]" border="0"><STRONG>What does AUTOCORRELATION do ?</STRONG>	Program AUTOCORRELATION analyzes the spatial autocorrelationstructure of a variable by producing structure functions, calledcorrelograms, following various schemes of connections or distancesamong the data locations. This is a strictly univariate method; program<A HREF="mantel.html">MANTEL</A> makes it possible to produce a correlogram from multivariatedata. For quantitative data, autocorrelation is measured using Moran's<EM>I</EM> and Geary's <EM>c</EM> indices. For ordinal or nominal data,standard normal deviates (<EM>S.N.D.</EM>'s) are computed for eachdistance class. Each value is accompanied by the probability of it notbeing significantly different from zero (one-tailed test). How tointerpret correlograms is discussed by <A HREF="../references.html#1">Legendre &amp; Fortin (1989)</A>.	In the Macintosh version, the production of that list of link edgeshas been put in a different program called <A HREF="links.html">LINKS</A>. Finally,AUTOCORRELATION may also produce a file containing an upper triangularmatrix of distance classes among localities; that file, whose defaultname is CLASSEF, is required by program <A HREF="mantel.html">MANTEL</A> to compute amultivariate correlogram.<h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6>
