---title: R v3 updates---			<FONT SIZE=+2><b>I</b></FONT>t has been brought to my attention that R does not behave well under OS 8. As an interim measure,	I have set updated versions of <b>all</b> of R's version 3 modules. <br>I have also built a page explaining how to  <a href="../../../../en/labo/R/v3/emulation.html">use the R Package with an emulator</a>.<p>Here is the list of all the modules, the modifications I have made (if any) and their most recent version numbers.<p><ul>	<li> Piste 3.1.1  <p>		Re-compile, some cosmetic enhancements and the use of up to 55 variables		<p>	<li> AutoCorrelation 3.04 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> BioGeo 3.021 <p>		Bug fix in the cursor selection routine (it would crash your computer if you tried it first) (Merc 19 avri 2000  at 17:30:06 by PhC) <br>		Some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> Chrono 3.01 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> Cluster 3.02 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> Cocopan 1.03 <p>		Original version (I could not get it to re-compile)		<p>	<li> Convert 3.01 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> GeoDistances 3.02 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> Import-Export 3.01 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> K-Means 3.02 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> Links 3.01 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> Look 3.01 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> Mantel 3.01 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> PCoord 3.02  <p>		<h4>3.02d0: Vend 06 mars 1998</h4> <ul> 			<li>Fixed a bug when showing eigenvalues on-screen to the user			<li>Fixed a cosmetic bug where the string of question "How many coordinates will be rewritten"				was concatenated with the string of the next question, "How many eigenvectors are to be compared".				This did not affect the order of the questions.			</ul>		<p>	<li> Periodograph 3.01 <p>		Simple re-compile and some cosmetic enhancements		<p>	<li> PnComp 3.1 (MAXVAR=105) <p>		Re-compiled with a maximum of 105 variables		<p>	<li> Simil 3.02  <p> 		<h4>3.02b1: Merc 01 juillet 1998</h4> <ul> 			<li>Added a new correction to the computation of D5 (between two groups): <br>				in the past, a null variance for one descriptor between two groups caused a singular dispersion matrix, which yielded				an undetermined distance coefficient. Now, S<small>IMIL</small> takes note when this happens and removes said descriptor from the				distance coefficient computation between thoses two groups only.			</ul>		<h4>3.02b0: Lund 29 juin 1998</h4> <ul> 			<li> Mahalanobis Distance computation procedure (D5) completely re-written; does not crash anymore			</ul>		<h4>3.02d0: Vend 20 F&eacute;vr 1998</h4> <ul> 			<li>Fixed a bug where only the first partial similarity matrix would be read.				(S16 and S20)				Simil 3.01 used the <em>last</em> partial similarity matrix in the data file in lieu of all the matrices. Simil 1.01 does not exhibit this problem, but that version does not work under System 7 so is accessible only to people with pre-1991 Macintosh 				computers that will run System 6.			<li>Added two new distance coefficients, D15 and D16 as seen in Legendre & Legendre, <a href="http://numericalecology.com/">Numerical Ecology</a> 2nd Edition (1998)			</ul>		<p>	<li> VerNorm 3.01 <p>		Fixed a bug where you could not make data positive if you had less objects than descriptors <br>		Fixed miscellaneous display bugs		<p>	</ul>			<p>			<hr>			<h6 align=center>				Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A> <br>				Created on  Friday, March 06, 1998				</h6>			<!--<h6 align="center"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://www.jsp.umontreal.ca/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=http://twitter.com/philippeclabo/R/v3/nouveau.html"> accesses since February 22nd, 2000</h6>-->		</TD>	</TR></TABLE>
