---title: R 4.0 for Windows---<h2>R 4.0 for Windows</h2><!--<h3><img src="../../../../images/new2.gif" height="11" width="28" alt="new2 picture" border="0">If you want to do K-Means, Links (Delaunay triangulation) or PCA (Principal Components Analysis) on a Windows PC, see <a href="../../../../Q/old.html">The Q Package</a>.</h3>-->There is a Windows version of The R Package currently in development. This version, intended for Windows 95 and later version of the operating system, will have a graphical user interface built with Borland's <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi/">Delphi</a>. The computational core of R will simply be compiled into a library (DLL) which will be required by the user interface. This core will be shared between the MacOS and the Windows version, which will ensure a high quality of computational accuracy by leveraging the 15+ years of development of R on the MacOS, VAX and VM/CMS. Furthermore, having only one source base will simplify bug management when they are found.To be informed as soon as the first (development) version of the R Package for Windows is released, you can subscribe to the mailing list by sending a blank email message to: <blockquote><a href="mailto:r-windows-l-on@biol09.biol.umontreal.ca">r-windows-l-on@biol09.biol.umontreal.ca</a></blockquote>Or you can check back on this website.In the meantime, please see our <a href="../../../../en/labo/R/emulation.html">emulation page</a>.			<p>			<hr>			<h6 align=center>				Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A> <br>				Created on  Wednesday, March 14, 2001				</h6>			<!--<h6 align="center"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://www.jsp.umontreal.ca/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=http://twitter.com/philippeclabo/R/v4/windows.html"> accesses since February 22nd, 2000</h6>-->		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></body></html>
