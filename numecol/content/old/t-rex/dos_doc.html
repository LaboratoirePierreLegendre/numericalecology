---title: Using T-REX (DOS Console)---			<h2 align=center>How to use T-R<small>EX</small><br>(32-bit DOS Console version)</h2><ol>	<li>Start the program by double-clicking on its icon under Windows 95/98/NT (required)	<li> Enter the dissimilarity matrix's file name. Ther input file must be a text (ASCII) file, containing the lower triangular (no diagonal) of the dissimilarity matrix. Values in the matrix should be separated by blanks (spaces) or tabs, as seen in the sample files.	<li> Select one of the five reconstruction methods proposed. If you select the MW method you should also specify whether to use local or global optimization, and define the matrix of weights. This latter matrix can either be a file (same format as above) or a function of the dissimilarity matrix: W = 1/(D^p) where W is the weight, D is the dissimilarity and you specify p. If you enter 0.0 for p, then all weights W will be 1.</ol>The results are saved in a text (ASCII) file named "Output", which contains the fitted distance matrix, the list of edges with their lengths in the corresponding tree and the values of 4 criteria of goodness of fit: (weighted) sum of least squares differences, total length of the tree, (weighted) average absolute difference and (weighted) maximum absolute difference.  If you wish to have a graphical representation of the tree, you can either build it yourself using the tree edge information, or use the <a href="../../../en/labo/t-rex/mac_doc.html">Macintosh version</a> of this program.<h3>Contact information</h3>Please contact only <A HREF="http://www.info2.uqam.ca/~makarenv/">Vladimir Makarenkov</A> for information about this version.			<p>			<hr>			<h6 align=center>				Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A> <br>				Created on  Tuesday, December 08, 1998				</h6>			<!--<h6 align="center"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://www.jsp.umontreal.ca/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=http://twitter.com/philippeclabo/t-rex/dos_doc.html"> accesses since February 22nd, 2000</h6>-->		</TD>	</TR></TABLE>
