T-REX will now compute the fitted distance matrix, tree or reticulogram edges and tree or reticulogram statistics, which will appear in a new text window. A second window will contain the tree or reticulogram drawing. You can copy the information appearing in both windows to the clipboard, to be pasted into your favorite text or picture editor. The information in both windows can also be saved and printed.</OL><a href="screenshot-trex.html">T-R<small>EX</small> screenshot</a>, showing a phylogenetic tree and reticulation networkinferred from a dissimilarity matrix among nine species of frogs (see Case,1978 for more information).<H3>General Information about T-R<small>EX</small></H3>	This program carries out some algorithms for the reconstruction of additive (phylogenetic) trees        and reticulograms given a dissimilarity matrix. Additive trees can also be inferred        from data matrices containing missing values. An additive tree distance or a        reticulogram distance is fitted to the given dissimilarity.As far as additive tree reconstruction is concerned, the program carries out five        methods of fitting an additive distance (distance representable by a tree with        non-negative edge lengths) to a given dissimilarity.                The following methods are available:<OL TYPE=1 START="1">			<LI>ADDTREE by Sattath and Tversky (1977),			<LI>Neighbor-joining (NJ) method by Saitou and Nei (1987),			<LI>Unweighted neighbor-joining method (UNJ) by Gascuel (1997),			<LI>Circular order reconstruction method by Makarenkov and Leclerc (1997), and Yushmanov (1984),			<LI>Weighted least-squares method MW by Makarenkov and Leclerc (1999).</OL>	You will find more information about these methods in the Additive Tree        reconstruction section of the T-REX Help manuel.	When reconstructing additive trees from dissimilarity matrices containing        missing values, the following methods are available:<OL TYPE=1 START="1">		<LI>Triangle method by Gu&eacute;noche (1999),		<LI>Ultrametric procedure for estimation of missing values by De Soete (1984) and     		   Landry <i>et al.</i> (1996) followed by the MW method,		<LI>Additive procedure for estimation of missing values by Landry <i>et al.</i> (1996)     		   followed by the MW method,		<LI>Weighted least-squares method MW by Makarenkov and Leclerc (1999), with weights of 1 to existing trees and 0 to the missing ones.</OL>	With reticulogram reconstruction, the program first computes a classical        additive tree using one of the five available tree reconstruction algorithms.        Then, at each step of the reticulogram reconstruction procedure, a reticulation        (i.e., new edge) is chosen to minimize the least-squares or the weighted        least-squares loss function. That edge is then added to the growing reticulogram.        You will find more information about these methods in the Reticulogram reconstruction        section of the T-REX Help manuel.	As results T-REX provides:	<ol><li>A window with the tree or reticulogram fitting statistics:			<ol>			<li>The fitted additive or reticulogram distance matrix,			<li>The list of the tree or reticulogram edges with their lengths,			<li>The values of the (weighted) least-squares criterion, the (weighted) average    			   absolute difference, the (weighted) maximum absolute difference and the total           		   length of the obtained tree or reticulogram. If reticulogram reconstruction is    			   performed the program also provides the values of the (weighted) least-    			   squares criterion, as well as the values of the goodness-of-fit criterion Q1 or Q2     			   for each reticulation added to the basic additive tree.    		</ol>		<li>A window with the tree or reticulogram drawing. The tree edges are depicted by full lines		   and the supplementary edges (reticulations) are depicted by dashed lines.	</ol>			<p>			<hr>			<h6 align=center>				Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A> <br>				Created on  Thursday, September 14, 2000				</h6>			<!--<h6 align="center"><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://www.jsp.umontreal.ca/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=http://twitter.com/philippeclabo/t-rex/win_doc.html"> accesses since February 22nd, 2000</h6>-->		</TD>	</TR></TABLE>
