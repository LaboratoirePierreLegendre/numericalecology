You can turn it on and off with the "Help" menu, or click on the <img src="../../../images/lightbulb-t.gif" height="16" width="16" align="middle" alt="lightbulb" border="0"> icon in the T-R<small>EX</small> dialog.	<li>Open or Import a dissimilarity matrix<blockquote>		<b>T-R<small>EX</small> requires its input to be in the S<small>IMIL</small> format</b>, used by the <a href="../../../en/labo/R/v3/index.html">R Package</a>. This is a binary format that cannot be created directly in a text editor. These files are created with programs such as <a href="../../../en/labo/R/v3/description/simil.html">Simil</a> and <a href="../../../en/labo/R/v3/description/importexport.html">Import-Export</a> of the <a href="../../../en/labo/R/v3/index.html">R Package</a>. 	<ul>		<li>If your input file is a text (ASCII) file, then you must import it using the menu command "File...Import". In the resulting dialog, specify what your input file looks like and click "Import". A new window will open containing your imported input file, which may then be used by T-R<small>EX</small> to perform tree reconstruction. You can also save the new window in a S<small>IMIL</small>-type file, and open it later. 		<li>If you already have a S<small>IMIL</small>-type file, then open it using the menu command "File...Open". 	</ul>Note that you can't import a rectangular file, since T-R<small>EX</small> has no use for them (<a href="#FAQ">see below</a>)</blockquote><li>Look at the resulting window to ensure that this is the matrix you wanted	<li>Select Reconstruct a tree... or Reconstruct a reticulogram...  in the T-REX menu	<li>Choose one of the five tree reconstruction methods for your additive tree (left-hand side of the dialog), and select what to output on the right-hand side.<p><strong>If you have chosen to reconstruct a reticulogram</strong>, you must select a stopping rule for adding reticulations:<ul>	<li> When function Q1 reaches its minimum	<li> When function Q2 reaches its minimum	<li> When K reticulations have been added, where K varies from 0 to (2n-2)(2n-3)/2 - (2n-3).</ul>For more information about these functions, either turn on Balloon Help in the program, see the User's guide (in .pdf format) included in the distribution or refer to <a href="index.html#ref">Makarenkov & Legendre (1999)</a>.</ol>T-R<small>EX</small> will now compute the fitted distance matrix, tree/reticulogram edges and tree/reticulogram statistics which will appear in two windows. One is a S<small>IMIL</small>-type window (same as your input file) which can be saved to disk or exported as text (for use in other programs). You can also select within the window and copy the information to the clipboard, for instance to paste it in a spreadsheet program. The other window is a text display widow which can also be saved, copied to the clipboard and printed (pending implementation in <a href="../../../en/labo/R/v4/index.html">the R Package 4.0</a>. See the <a href="#FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a> below).If requested, T-R<small>EX</small> will also display a graphical representation of the fitted distance matrix (and tree/reticulogram edges) in a separate, resizable window. Three types of graphical representation - hierarchical, radial and axial drawings - are available. The user may also choose the root of the tree over the set of all existing vertices, as well as handle some extra features of the graphical representation.<strong>Note:</strong> You can modify a window's properties (for instance, header information or drawing characteristics) by selecting Properties in the Edit menu, or by double-clicking in the window. This is especially useful for the tree/reticulogram window.<h3><a name="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h3><dl>	<dt><i>Why must I "Import" my data matrices to use T-R<small>EX</small>?</i> 	<dd><p>T-R<small>EX</small> shares almost all of its user interface routines with <a href="../../../en/labo/R/v4/index.html">the R Package 4.0</a> being developed by <A HREF="http://twitter.com/philippec">Philippe Casgrain</A>. Therefore, as <a href="../../../en/labo/R/v4/index.html">R 4.0</a>'s interface code becomes more robust, T-R<small>EX</small> will automatically benefit from the enhancements. Moreover, within <a href="../../../en/labo/R/v4/index.html">R 4.0</a>, there are two data file formats: rectangular (nxp) and S<small>IMIL</small>. Rectangular matrices may have any number of rows (objects) and columns (descriptors, or variables) and contain very different information, from X-Y coordinates to water pH. In contrast, a S<small>IMIL</small> matrix is quite homogeneous, describing only the resemblance between n objects. This type of matrix is thus treated as a special case of the rectangular matrix, and has its own window type: it is symmetrical, the row and column headers are the same, and the diagonal contains either 1s or 0s (if it's a similarity or distance matrix).We felt that since T-R<small>EX</small> dealt with dissimilarity matrices, it was much easier to use the routines we had already built and tested for parsing and representing input files rather than reading ASCII text each time. Of course, you can export a S<small>IMIL</small> file to a text file, and you can select and copy from the window with ease (see the "Edit" menu).	<dt><i>Do you plan to add more tree reconstruction methods to T-R<small>EX</small>?</i>	<dd><p>Yes!
