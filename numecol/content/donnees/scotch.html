Dear lover of Scotch whiskies and numerical data analysis,
<p>
Here are the Scotch whisky data (109 distilleries) used in the following paper:
<blockquote>
Lapointe, F.-J. & P. Legendre. 1994. <a href="../reprints/Appl Stat 43, 1994.pdf">A classification of pure malt Scotch whiskies</a>. <i>Applied Statistics</i> <b>43</b>: 237-257.
</blockquote>
<p>
There are 5 data sets: color, nose, body, palate, and finish. The binary (0-1) descriptors are in the same order as on p. 239 of the paper. In any case, they are all assembled (with identifiers) in an Excel data base, also included.
<p>
We also send you the list of geographic coordinates of the distilleries, given as decimal degrees: longitude WEST, followed by latitude NORTH. In Scotland, one degree north is about 1.87 times as long as one degree west.
To be complete, We are also including a matrix of geographic distances among distilleries, already computed and written out as an ASCII file.
<p>
There are two whiskies in the classification from the Springbank distillery. One pertains to the Islay group, the other to the Western group.
<p>
Please let us know of the analysis you have performed, especially if you intend on publishing them.
