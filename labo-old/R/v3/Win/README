NOTEDevelopment of the Windows version of the "R" Package has been halted for an indefinite period of time. We apologize for the inconvenience thismight cause you. In the meanwhile, Macintosh and VAX/VMS versions (the latterincluding source code) remain at your disposal.You may also want to check out the Q Package, available on this web site.Philippe Casgrain <casgrain@magellan.umontreal.ca>26-Aug-2002
