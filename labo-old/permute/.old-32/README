                      Permute! v3.2 distribution                           Philippe Casgrain     casgrain@ere.umontreal.ca (or) casgrain@biology.lsa.umich.edu*** Macintosh version only in this folder ***Available via anonymous ftp:ftp://ftp.umontreal.ca/pub/casgrain/evolution/    This is the program used to compute multiple regression coefficients andtheir probability in Legendre, Lapointe and Casgrain (1994) Evolution 48:1487.    This package contains the version used by the authors to write the article.As I am writing this README file, I am in the process of re-writing the programwith a better interface and to take advantage of the greater speed offered byPowerPC-based Macintoshes. I am also plugging a couple of memory "leaks", whichshould allow me to develop a Windows and a Unix version (I have tried unsuccessfully before).*** IMPORTANT MESSAGE ***    If you want to be kept up-to-date with the latest release of the program,may I suggest that you send me e-mail (mailto:casgrain@ere.umontreal.ca)requesting to be added to my mailing list. That way, when new bugs are discovered (and fixed!), and new versions are released, you will know as soonas I put the file on the ftp server.    Should you find what you think is a bug, please e-mail me the details soI can tell you if it's a feature (!) or a real bug, if there is a workaroundand if/when I will fix it. Please describe the circumstances (computer model,RAM allocation, system version, program version) and send me a copy of thedata files you used. I value my user's input, so if you have comments, complaints or compliments feel free to address them to me.*** End of important message ***In this self-extracting archive, you should find the following files:    Article Data: -- Data files for the "Evolution 48:1487" article        Marsupials X 406*6 -- The 6 independent matrices, unfolded        Marsupials Y 406*1 -- The dependent matrix, unfolded    Command file EXAMPLE -- See the documentation    Permute! 3 Doc -- Documentation in stand-alone format    Permute! 3.2 (noFPU) -- Application Program for all Macintoshes    Permute! 3.2 (FPU) -- Program (identical) for FPU (Floating-point unit,                          or co-processor)-equipped Macs (*)    README -- This fileIf you are missing some files, contact me immediately via e-mail.(*) In some cases (see the documentation), p-values may be erratic in the FPU version. The noFPU version has no such problems. Causes of this behaviorare unknown to me at the moment.The distribution file exists in two formats: one called "binhexed" (a textfile, permute-32.hqx) and one in Macbinary format (permute-32.bin). If you knowhow to de-binhex a file, then that's the one you should get because it willget to you intact for sure. If you can't de-binhex, you can grab theMacbinary file (set your FTP client to binary) but I can't guarantee it will work. That depends on your system and Internet connexion.If you have troubles with the files, please e-mail me.Philippe Casgrain, casgrain@ere.umontreal.ca10-Aug-1995
